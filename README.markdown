MonoTouch.Extensions
====================

MonoTouch.Extensions provides functionality to MonoTouch classes (technically, CocoaTouch classes)
that isn't provided by default, but is often asked "how do I do this?" For example, to have you 
MKMapView zoom to given point, you'd have to write your own code (or copy/paste it rom somewhere).
With MonoTouch.Extensions, you won't have to write that method youself!


Using MonoTouch.Extensions
==========================

Simply add the MonoTouch.Extensions project to your solution, and add a using statement to the
top of the file.

	using MonoTouch.Extensions;
